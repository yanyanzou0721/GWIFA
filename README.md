## Inputï¼š
```
Required:
    matrix : full matrix generated by "cooler dump" form contact file
    organ  : name of your input
    cnv_info : a focal amplified region in bed format
    chrom_length_info : chromosome length infomation with tab delimiter
    drop_chrom : excluded chromosome
    resolution : resolution of the matrix
    
Optional:
    pre :  if you have already run the script once 
    fit
    spacing=3
    ymin=-100
    ymax=100
    outdir="./"
    outfig="test"
```

## Output:
    1. {organ}_target_region.xls, interaction information between  the focal amplified region and whole Genome
    2. Second_Derivation.pdf,  figure of the final result
